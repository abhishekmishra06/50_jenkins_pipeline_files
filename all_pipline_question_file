Beginner Level (1–15): Getting Started
Hello World Pipeline: Create a simple pipeline that prints "Hello, Jenkins!" to the console.

Basic Build Stage: Add a Build stage that echoes "Building the project...".

Multiple Stages: Introduce Test and Deploy stages with corresponding echo statements.

Environment Variables: Define and use an environment variable within your pipeline.

Using the agent Directive: Specify an agent for your pipeline execution.

Simple Shell Command: Execute a basic shell command like ls or pwd.

Parameterize Build: Add a string parameter to your pipeline and print its value.

Conditional Execution: Use the when directive to conditionally run a stage based on a parameter.

Post Actions: Implement post actions to handle success and failure scenarios.

Pipeline Input: Add an input step to pause the pipeline for manual approval.

Timeouts: Set a timeout for a stage to prevent it from running indefinitely.

Retry Mechanism: Use the retry block to retry a failed step a specified number of times.

Parallel Stages: Execute two stages in parallel to speed up the pipeline.

Workspace Cleanup: Clean the workspace before or after the pipeline execution.

Build Number: Access and print the current build number using env.BUILD_NUMBER.







Intermediate Level (16–35): Expanding Skills
Checkout SCM: Use the checkout scm step to pull code from your repository.

Archiving Artifacts: Archive build artifacts for later use.

Email Notifications: Send an email notification upon build completion.

Slack Integration: Integrate Slack to send build notifications.

Tool Installation: Use the tools directive to install and use Maven or JDK.

Parameterized Builds: Trigger a downstream job with parameters.

Shared Libraries: Create and use a shared library in your pipeline.

Credentials Management: Access stored credentials securely within the pipeline.

Docker Integration: Build and run a Docker container as part of the pipeline.

Matrix Builds: Set up a matrix build to test across multiple environments.

Multibranch Pipeline: Configure a multibranch pipeline to handle multiple branches.

Git Tagging: Tag the repository upon successful build completion.

Stashing Files: Use stash and unstash to pass files between stages.

Artifact Fingerprinting: Enable fingerprinting to track artifacts across builds.

Pipeline Parameters: Use different types of parameters like boolean, choice, etc.

Build Triggers: Set up triggers to start the pipeline on code changes.

Pipeline as Code: Store your pipeline script in the repository as a Jenkinsfile.

Blue Ocean Visualization: Use Blue Ocean to visualize and manage pipelines.

Pipeline Libraries: Organize reusable code in pipeline libraries.

Custom Workspace: Define and use a custom workspace for your pipeline.




Advanced Level (36–50): Mastery and Optimization
Dynamic Agent Allocation: Dynamically allocate agents based on build requirements.

Parallel Test Execution: Run tests in parallel to reduce execution time.

Quality Gates: Integrate tools like SonarQube to enforce code quality gates.

Infrastructure as Code: Use tools like Terraform within your pipeline.

Security Scanning: Integrate security scanning tools like OWASP ZAP.

Performance Testing: Run performance tests using tools like JMeter.

Canary Deployments: Implement canary deployment strategies.

Blue-Green Deployments: Set up blue-green deployment workflows.

Rollback Mechanism: Implement a rollback mechanism in case of deployment failure.

Custom Plugins: Develop and use custom Jenkins plugins.

API Integration: Interact with external APIs during the pipeline execution.

Pipeline Metrics: Collect and analyze pipeline execution metrics.

Resource Locking: Use the lock step to prevent concurrent access to resources.

Nested Pipelines: Call and manage nested pipelines for complex workflows.

Disaster Recovery: Set up backup and restore strategies for Jenkins configurations.
